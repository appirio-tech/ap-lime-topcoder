        h2.content-question So what exactly is Swiftoberfest?

        p Swiftoberfest is an initiative to engage and grow the Topcoder iOS Community with dozens of new iOS/Swift challenges. We’ve identified 10 key enterprises that want to design, prototype, and build apps before the end of the year, and by participating in these challenges over the next few months you can earn cash as well as win great prizes like an Apple TV or MacBook Pro!

        h2.content-question How long does it last?

        p While Oktoberfest lasts for just 16 days, Swiftoberfest will continue until we complete all challenges necessary to build the 10 enterprise apps. We want Swiftoberfest to be fun and rewarding, and also provide you with lots of chances to improve and get recognized for your Swift skills. So whether you’re new to Topcoder or a long-time member interested in trying new types of challenges, we hope you’ll join us in raising a stein to great challenges, a vibrant and growing community, and many months of Swift awesomeness!
