      p Swiftoberfest was a three-month program in late 2015 to engage and grow the Topcoder iOS Community with dozens of new Swift/iOS Challenges. We gave away lots of cash and tons of great prizes to iOS Community members for earning badges and competing in design and development challenges for select enterprise customers. While Swiftoberfest is officially over, there are still lots of Swift/iOS challenges for you to compete in, and weâ€™ll have more fun programs for the iOS Community in 2016!
