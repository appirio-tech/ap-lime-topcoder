        span.title How to Enter:

        | <strong>Online Submissions only.</strong> Build the winning solution for top companies - the companies who are looking for the best in iOS application development.  Any challenge during the Contest Period that contains the hashtag #swiftoberfest qualifies for this Contest.

      p You must be a member and have a TopCoder account to participate.   Go to #[a(href="http://ios.topcoder.com/") www.ios.topcoder.com] to open an account.  You may submit your winning solution entries through the usual Topcoder website or  here for the challenges within the timeframe of the challenges (a Swiftoberfest challenge will say #swiftoberfest in the title).

      p Next, submit your coding solution and make sure you receive an UPLOAD confirmation once the upload of your Submission is complete. If you do not receive this confirmation, your Submission was not uploaded successfully and you have not been entered.

      p All contact information provided must be current, accurate and valid. Submissions must be received no later than the deadlines listed, according to Sponsor’s time. No other methods of delivery will be accepted. All entries received by the end of the Submission Period that are complete and otherwise qualified will be eligible to win (“Qualified Submissions”). Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Contestant it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Contest or violating these Official Rules. All Submissions become the sole property of Sponsor and will not be acknowledged or returned. Sponsor is not responsible for incomplete, late, lost, delayed, damaged, misdirected, incomplete, void, corrupted, garbled, illegible, or unintelligible submissions and those Submissions are void and will not be accepted; nor is Sponsor responsible for any problems, bugs or malfunctions Contestants may encounter when seeking to enter their Submissions.

    li

        span.title Guidelines for all submissions:

        | All Submissions must be original works of authorship, created by the person who submits the entry. Contestants may not copy or otherwise plagiarize the Submission from any source. By entering, you warrant that your Submission does not infringe any third party’s rights, and that you have obtained all necessary permissions from all relevant third parties to submit the Submission.

      p Although Sponsor is not reviewing Submissions for copyright violations, if, in the sole discretion of Sponsor, it is believed your Submission constitutes or may constitute copyright infringement, the Submission will be disqualified.  Contestant must hold all rights to the entire Submission. Contestant agrees to indemnify Sponsor against any and all claims of infringement from any third party for any use by Sponsor of Submission. Contestants must not enter a Submission that would prohibit Sponsor from using, royalty-free, the Submission worldwide in all media in perpetuity.

      p Sponsor reserves the right to exclude any Submission that it believes doesn't meet the above criteria, at its sole discretion.
