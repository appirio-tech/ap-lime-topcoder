      p Become part of the extensive, global Apple Developer Community powered by Appirio. Developers of all kinds join the community to raise their game&mdash;to find mentors, to collaborate and to learn from each other, but ultimately to stand out from the crowd, by submitting (and being paid for) your best ideas.

    .banner-text(ng-show="main.loggedInUser && !main.loggedInUser.memberSince")
      p Thanks for joining. Before you can compete, you'll need to confirm your email account with topcoder, so be sure to check your email for the activation link.
